# Warning: Here Be Dragons
# Inheritance is a tricky concept, so let's go through it step by step.

# Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another, and it's used to express an is-a relationship. For example, a Panda is a bear, so a Panda class could inherit from a Bear class. However, a Toyota is not a Tractor, so it shouldn't inherit from the Tractor class (even if they have a lot of attributes and methods in common). Instead, both Toyota and Tractor could ultimately inherit from the same Vehicle class.

# Instructions
# Check out the code in the editor. We've defined a class, Customer, as well as a ReturningCustomer class that inherits from Customer. Note that we don't define the display_cart method in the body of ReturningCustomer, but it will still have access to that method via inheritance. Click Save & Submit Code to see for yourself!


class Customer(object):
    """Produces objects that represent customers."""
    def __init__(self, customer_id):
        self.customer_id = customer_id

    def display_cart(self):
        print "I'm a string that stands in for the contents of your shopping cart!"

class ReturningCustomer(Customer):
    """For customers of the repeat variety."""
    def display_order_history(self):

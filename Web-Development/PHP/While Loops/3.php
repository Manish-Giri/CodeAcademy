<!-- Your First While Loop
Now it is time for you to write your own while loop from scratch. Maybe you could reproduce the behavior of one of your for loops from the previous course, or you could try to write your own coin flip program. The beauty of programming is that you can do whatever you want!

Unless you want to write an infinite loop on purpose (which you don't!), do not write infinite loops! And if you find you have submitted one, refresh the page to stop it.

Instructions
Write the code for your own while loop below the comment inside the <?php ?> tags. Then click Save & Submit Code to see the results of your loop. -->

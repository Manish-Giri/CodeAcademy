<!-- Comments
Just like we sometimes put comments in our CSS (using /* this syntax */) or in our HTML (using <!-- this syntax -->), we can also put comments in our PHP code! We do that using two forward slashes (//), like so:

<?php
    echo "I get printed!";
    // I don't! I'm a comment.
?>
Instructions
Go ahead and add a comment to our PHP code. It can say whatever you like!

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Oh No!</title>
	</head>
	<body>
        <p><?php
            echo "Oh, the humanity!";
          ?></p>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- Variables
So far we've been outputting strings and doing math.

To do more complex coding, we need a way to "save" these values. We can do this using variables. A variable can store a string or a number, and gives it a specific case-senstive name.

Examples:

$myName = "Beyonce";
$myAge = 32;
All variable names in PHP start with a dollar sign ( $ ).

Instructions
On line 8, create a variable named $myName and set it equal to your name. Make sure to end your PHP code with a semicolon. -->

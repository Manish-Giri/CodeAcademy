<!-- What's a Loop?
Programming can be tough work, and sometimes it's made tougher by having to do the same thing over and over. Let's say we want to echo a list of leap years in the editor. You might think we'd have to type:

<?php
    echo 2004;
    echo 2008;
    echo 2012;
    // And so on
?>
But there's a better way!

A loop is a useful bit of code that repeats a series of instructions for you. For instance, instead of typing echo many times like we did above, we can simply use the code in the editor to the right!

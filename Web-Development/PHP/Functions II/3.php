<!-- Your First Function
Writing our name can be a dull task when we don't have fun functions to help out. In this exercise, we'll be writing our very first user-defined PHP function that will do just that for us!

Instructions
On line 10, write a function called displayName, that takes no parameters and will echo a string that contains your name. Check out the Hint if you need help! -->

	<body>
      <p>
        <?php
        // Write your function below!
        function displayName() {
            echo "Manish Giri";
        }
        
        
        
        ?>
      </p>

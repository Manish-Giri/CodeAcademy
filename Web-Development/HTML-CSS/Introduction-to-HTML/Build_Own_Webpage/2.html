<!--Every house needs a frame
An HTML page is sort of like a house: it needs a certain number of essential structures in order to work.

Just like a house, an HTML page needs a frame. In this case, your frame is made of <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

Instructions
Your webpage is blank as the day it was born! Let's add five things:

The <!DOCTYPE> tag
Your <html> tags
Your <head> tags
<title> tags (with any title you like!) between your head tags
Your <body> tags
?-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        
    <title>Let's Go!'</title>    
    </head>
    
    <body>
        
    </body>
    
    
</html>

<!-- Fixing your header
Great work!

Now it's time to fix your header—literally—so it stays put on the page as people reading your resume scroll down.

If you read the first exercise's CSS carefully, you'll see we've snuck in a little trick for you: the z-index property. You can think of the z-index as a measure of importance: the higher an element's z-index, the higher it will be "stacked" on the page. Giving your header a z-index of 1 while not giving any of the other elements a z-index ensures that your header will sit "on top of" your other elements and won't get stuck behind them.

Instructions
Give your #header a position of fixed and a z-index of 1. -->

<!-- Positioning your button
Nice work! Now we'll work on centering your button on the page.

We'll go over positioning in the next course or two, but we think it's a good idea to give you a preview here. Here's how it works:

margin: auto; is the CSS you use to tell the browser: "Hey! Make sure to set equal margins on each side of this HTML element." When the margins are equal, the object is centered.
text-align: center; is how you center text elements.
Instructions
On the CSS tab, set your div's margin to auto and its text-align property to center. -->

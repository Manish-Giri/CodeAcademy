		<p>Much of this is regular text, but some of it is <span>fancy</span>!
		We can use our <span>newly fancified font</span> to add some
		<span>flair</span> to our website. It'd be a <span>royal pain</span> 
		to make each of these span tags <span>fancy</span> individually,
		but it's a cinch with <span>CSS</span>!</p>

<!-- Some photos on your table
You know all about tables now. But did you know that tables are useful for much more than formatting text?

You can use a table to create a beautifully formatted grid of photos.

You'll notice we've included an extra file in this project: stylesheet.css. You'll be learning about CSS in the next lesson and project, but we thought you might like a sneak peek here. This file will help format your HTML to keep it looking great.

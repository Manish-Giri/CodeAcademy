<!-- Inline-block
Good work! If you didn't notice much of a difference, don't worry. Our <div>s were block elements by default; as we specify different display values, they'll start to move around.

As mentioned, any element that comes in as a block (say, a paragraph) will automatically take up the full width of the page, no matter how much or how little content you put in.

If we specify a display of inline-block, however, our blocks are still blocks, but will be able to sit next to each other on the same line.

Instructions
Change the display property of all your <div>s so the value is now inline-block instead of block. --><!DOCTYPE html>

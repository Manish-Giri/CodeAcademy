<!--You have the power!
Have you ever seen your page on a social networking site load really slowly, then come through with only the HTML skeleton? (If not, it looks like this. Crazy, right?)

Under its fancy skin, a social networking profile is just a list of text, images, and links. And you know all about those!

We've set up your profile page with the basics, but the details are up to you. First off, let's make this page about you!

Instructions
Put your name between the <title></title> tags.
Put a picture of yourself (or anything you like!) between the <body></body> tags.
 If you can't think of a good picture, use this ninja: http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/ninja_zpsa5dbe37a.jpg.-->

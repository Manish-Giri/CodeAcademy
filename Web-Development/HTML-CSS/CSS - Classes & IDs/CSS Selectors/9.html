Excellent! You've got the hang of this, and you're starting to learn more about cascading.

As we mentioned, certain selectors will "override" others if they have a greater specificity value. ul li p { is more specific CSS than just p {, so when CSS sees tags that are both <p> tags and happen to be inside unordered lists, it will apply the more specific styling (ul li p {) to the text inside the lists.

There are two selectors that are even more specific than nested selectors like the ones above: classes and IDs. Check them out in the editor to the right.

Instructions
See how the classes and IDs alter the way the paragraph looks? (Note how the li p { CSS overrides the p { CSS, and the class .list_item overrides the li p { CSS.)

			<p>When you set a property of a selector like 'p' to a certain value, that value applies to <em>all</em> p tags.
			If, however, you change that same property to a different value for a more specific instance of p,
			that change will <em>override</em> the 'general rule'.

			<ul>
				<li><p>If you say p { font-family: Garamond}, all 'p's will have the font Garamond.</p></li>
				<li><p class="list_item">BUT if you say li p {font-family: Verdana}, 'p's outside of 'li's will be
					   in Garamond, and 'p's INSIDE 'li's will be in Verdana.
				</p></li>
				<li><p class="list_item">The more specific your selectors are, the higher importance CSS gives to the styling you apply!</p></li>

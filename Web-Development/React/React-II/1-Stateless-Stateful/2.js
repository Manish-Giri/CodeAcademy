// Let's learn our first programming pattern!
//
// In this lesson, we'll take a look at a simple version of a programming pattern. The following lessons will expand upon that lesson, and by the end, we'll have a programming pattern in its full complexity.
//
// Our programming pattern uses two React components: a stateful component, and a stateless component. "Stateful" describes any component that has a getInitialState function; "stateless" describes any component that does not.
//
// In our pattern, a stateful component passes its state down to a stateless component.

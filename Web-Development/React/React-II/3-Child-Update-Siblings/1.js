Patterns within patterns within patterns!

    In lesson 1, you learned your first React programming pattern: a stateful, parent component passes down a prop to a stateless, child component.

    In lesson 2, you learned that lesson 1's pattern is actually part of a larger pattern: a stateful, parent component passes down an event handler to a stateless, child component. The child component then uses that event handler to update its parent's state.

    In this lesson, we will expand the pattern one last time. A child component updates its parent's state, and the parent passes that state to a sibling component.

An understanding of this final pattern will be very helpful in the wild, not to mention in the next React course. Click Next and we'll build an example!*/

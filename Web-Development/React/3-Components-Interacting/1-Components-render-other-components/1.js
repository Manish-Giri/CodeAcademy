// A React application can contain dozens, or even hundreds, of components.
//
// Each component might be small and relatively unremarkable on its own. When combined, however, they can form enormous, fantastically complex ecosystems of information.
//
// In other words, React apps are made out of components, but what makes React special isn't components themselves. What makes React special is the ways in which components interact.
//
// This unit is an introduction to components interacting.

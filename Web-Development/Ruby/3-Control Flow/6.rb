# Equal or Not?
# In Ruby, we assign values to variables using =, the assignment operator. But if we've already used = for assignment, how do we check to see if two things are equal? Well, we use ==, which is a comparator (also called a relational operator). == means "is equal to." When you type

# x = 2
# y = 2
# if x == y
#   print "x and y are equal!"
# end
# you're saying: "if x equals y, print 'x and y are equal!'" You can also check to see if two values are not equal using the != comparator.

# Instructions
# We've got two variables in the editor: is_true and is_false. Replace the __ with == or != to make is_true evaluate to true and is_false evaluate to false.

is_true = 2 != 3

is_false = 2 == 3

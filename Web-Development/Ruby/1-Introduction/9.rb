'.upcase' & '.downcase'
Let's try one more method (er, two methods). As you might have guessed, the .upcase and .downcase methods convert a string to ALL UPPER CASE or all lower case, respectively.

Instructions
Call .upcase on your name to make your name ALL CAPS and use puts to print it to the screen, like this:

puts "eric".upcase
# ==> ERIC
On the next line, call .downcase to make your name all lower case. Make sure to use puts so you can see it printed out!

puts "manish".upcase

puts "MANISH".downcase

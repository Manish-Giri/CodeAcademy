Data Types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans
In Ruby, your information (or data) can come in different types. There are three data types in Ruby that we're interested in right now: numbers, booleans (which can be true or false), and strings (words or phrases like "I'm learning Ruby!").

Computer programs exist to quickly analyze and manipulate data. For that reason, it's important for us to understand the different data types that we can use in our programs.

Reminder: never use quotation marks (' or ") with booleans, or Ruby will think you're talking about a string (a word or phrase) instead of a value that can be true or false. It's also important to remember that Ruby is case-sensitive (it cares about capitalization).

Instructions
Set the following variables to the corresponding values:

my_num to the value 25
my_boolean to the value true
my_string to the value "Ruby" (note the capitalization!)

my_num =  25   # Add your code here!

my_boolean = true     # And here!

my_string = "Ruby"    # Also here.

# Arrays of Non-Numbers
# Here's something you might not have known: you can make an array of any collection of Ruby objects. You can make an array of booleans! An array of strings! The list is (almost) endless.

# Instructions
# Create a new array called string_array. Make it an array of... strings!

string_array = ["array", "of", "strings"]

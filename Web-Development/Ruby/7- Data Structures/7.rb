# Using Hash.new
# What we just showed you was hash literal notation. We call it that because you literally describe what you want in the hash: you give it a name and you set it equal to a bunch of key => value pairs inside curly braces.

# You can also create a hash using Hash.new, like so:

# my_hash = Hash.new
# Setting a variable equal to Hash.new creates a new, empty hash; it's the same as setting the variable equal to empty curly braces ({}).

# Instructions
# Use Hash.new to create a new hash called pets. Hash must be capitalized, or Ruby won't know what you're talking about!

pets = Hash.new

# Creating Arrays
# Earlier we saw that an array can be used to store a list of values in a single variable. You can stuff any number of numbers in there, you can repeat numbers, and they don't have to be in numeric order!

# Instructions
# Declare a variable, my_array, in the editor, and set it equal to an array of your choice. Check the Hint if you need a syntax refresher.

my_array = [10,2,33,400,5]

# Hashes
# Good! Now let's create a hash. Feel free to use either hash literal notation or Hash.new.

# prices = { 
#   "apple" => 0.52,
#   "banana" => 0.23,
#   "kiwi" => 1.42
# }

# sounds = Hash.new
# sounds["dog"] = "woof"
# sounds["cat"] = "meow"
# Instructions
# Create a hash called my_hash in the editor.
# Give it at least one key-value pair.

my_hash = { "code" => "Rails"}

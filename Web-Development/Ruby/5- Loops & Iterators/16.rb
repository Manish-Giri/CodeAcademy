# Looping with 'For'
# In case you're not picking up on the theme of Ruby having a gajillion ways to do any given task: let's convert our loop yet again.

# for k in 1..3
#   print k
# end
# In the above example, we print out 123 by virtue of looping from 1 to 3 inclusive.

# Instructions
# Now print out the numbers from 1 to 50 inclusive, using a for loop instead of an until loop.

for i in 1..50
print i
end

# Loop the Loop with Loop
# Great work! We'll give you a bit of a break from the numbers game.

# m= 0
# loop do
#     m += 1
#     print m
#     break if m == 10
# end
# In the example above, we print out 12345678910 since we loop 10 times.

# Instructions
# Use the loop iterator to print out the string "Ruby!" 30 times.

# Make sure to type the string exactly as shown!

i = 0
loop do 
    print "Ruby!"
    i += 1
    break if i == 30
end

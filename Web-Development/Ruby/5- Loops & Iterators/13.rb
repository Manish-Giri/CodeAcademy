# The .times Iterator
# The .times method is like a super compact for loop: it can perform a task on each item in an object a specified number of times.

# For example, if we wanted to print out "Chunky bacon!" ten times, we might type

# 10.times { print "Chunky bacon!" }
# We don't know why we would type that, but we could.

# Instructions
# Use the .times operator to print out a string of your choice any number of times you like. Use the code in the text above as a guide if you need hel

4.times {print "Hi Manish "}

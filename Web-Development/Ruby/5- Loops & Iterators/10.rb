# Saving Multiple Values
# Let's say we want to save a range of numbers in a variable. How would we do this? A variable can only hold a single value, right?

# In Ruby, we can pack multiple values into a single variable using an array. An array is just a list of items between square brackets, like so: [1, 2, 3, 4]. The items don't have to be in order—you can just as easily have [10, 31, 19, 400].

# Instructions
# Create a variable called my_array and set it equal to the numbers 1 through 5, inclusive, in order.

my_array = [1,2,3,4,5]
